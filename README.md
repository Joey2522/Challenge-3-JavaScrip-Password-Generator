# Challenge-3-JavaScrip-Password-Generator
This repo contains the documents for my UT Bootcamp Challenge # 3 JavaScrip Password Generator.

## Description

I was given an HTML file, a CSS file and small piece of a JS file from my UT bootcamp. The goal was to finish the JS file so my page would generate a password bases on the users preferences. I discovered there are many ways of accomplishing this task in JS. Ultimately, I settled for a method I came across in on stackoverflow.com. You can find the specific page with the code example here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61021441/random-password-generator-javascript

Once I was able to generate my code successfully I made some tweaks to the questions that are presented and thought through a few scenarios with a bootcamp tutor that encouraged me to add some "if elements" to the code as well. For example if the user input information into the window prompt that did not make sense with the question, they then would be asked to start over and told why they were being asked to do so.
